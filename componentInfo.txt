React Framework:
    - CRA ( Create React App ) : As I learn More about CRA Found following Pro for using CRA 
        Pros:
            - You don't need to break yourself in configuration. You can just focus yourself on building the app.
            - Saves a lot of time and energy as it provides a lot of common things out of the box.
            - Training a newcomer about your project is easy. You just need to train them about the project and point them to the create-react-app documentation for setup and configuration.
            - As it is maintained by Facebook, support for new features of React will be available immediately.
            - Updating to a new version is super easy. Just replace the version of react-scripts in package.json and run npm install. That's it.
            - Speaking of updating, as create-react-app takes care of handling under the hood things, updating things like webpack and babel will be taken care by them. We don't need to hassle with it again.

        As Every Coin has second side i found some cons as well for using CRA 
        Cons:
            - It provides an opinionated option for building a react app. Not everyone will like that.
            - It helps only if you are starting a project from scratch. It won't help on the case of your existing application where you need to partially migrate to react.
    
    As Above pros were enough to work on the project i have choosen CRA as Framework for this project 


Project DataFlow And Logic
    - Todo App will contain following Components
        - Wrapper
        - TodoList
        - TodoItem
        - TodoProgressFooter
    - Data Flow Among these Components will be :
            Wrapper ---⬇
                        |
                        |
                        Title
                        |
                        TodoList ---⬇
                                    TodoItems
                        |
                        Progress Footer
            
            Data flow will be from Wrapper Components to TodoList And ProgressFooter,TodoList And ProgressFooter are both strucutral components
    - Wrapper components holds todoCollection state variable which is object, object is used for faster element selection, functionality scaling, backword compatibility in case for onject change 
    - for example : todoCollection  = {
        1:{
            task:"Wake up at 5 AM",
            completed:false
        },
    }
    here 1 represent key of the task, task holds information of the content of the task, completed is an boolean field which represent wheather the task is completed or not 
    this collection will propogate through child components
